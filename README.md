# Oregon State University CS-361 Software Engineering

Group 2 fall 2019 CS-361 carbon footprint tracking application. The majority of the course was dedicated to designing the architecture of the system that our group was assigned. In the final 3 weeks our group's customer split the system into stories for each week long sprint and we implemented as much of the system as the sprints allowed. We set up the suthorization on one server and then it redirected the user to another server which served the user dashboard and allowed the user to update their personal information.
